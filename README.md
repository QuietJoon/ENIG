ENIG
====

ENIG is a acronym of typical Korean particles "Eun Neun I Ga (은는이가)".
Korean postposition particles changes its form from the pronounciation of previous consonant.
However, this puts programmers trouble because figure out the previous consonant is not easy problem.
Therefore, many of programmers who handles Korean treat Korean strings like "SOMETHING은(는) ~~".
This seems to be ugly like "SOMETHING is(are), Two apple(s)."

ENIG focuses on programmers who handling Korean strings.
