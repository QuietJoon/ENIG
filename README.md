ENIG
====

ENIG is an acronym of typical Korean particles "Eun Neun I Ga (은는이가)".
Korean postposition particles change their form depending on the pronounciation of the previous consonant.
However, in trouble, because figuring out the previous consonant is not an easy problem.
Therefore, most of the programmers who handle Korean treat Korean by starting with "SOMETHING은(는) ~~".
This seems to be awkward in a sentence like "SOMETHING is(are), Two apple(s)."

ENIG focuses on programmers to handle Korean strings.

## Long-range Plans

### Korean

* Managing Korean string which involves Korean particle.

### English

* Managing Korean string which involves plural/singular form.
