ENIG
====

ENIG is a acronym of typical Korean particles "Eun Neun I Ga (은는이가)".
Korean postposition particles changes their form depending on the pronounciation of previous consonant.
However, in trouble because figuring out the previous consonant is not an easy problem.
Therefore, most of the programmers who handle Korean treat Korean by starting with "SOMETHING은(는) ~~".
This seems to be awkward like "SOMETHING is(are), Two apple(s)."

ENIG focuses on programmers handle Korean strings.

## Long-range Plans

### Korean language
* Helping Korean string involving Korean particle.

### English langage
* Helping English string involving with plural/singular form.
